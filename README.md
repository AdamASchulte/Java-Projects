# Java-Projects

Here is a collection of some of my Java projects.

Threads: a project that reads a sudoku solution from a text file and checks if it is valid or not. It includes File IO, Multithreading, and logical array manipulation.

InterviewQuestions: A really great professor had us do a lab where we coded solutions to a bunch of typical interview questions. 

Sorting: All the basic sorting algorithms. (beside quicksort, which is implemented in Threads funny enough)

DynamicArry: I implemented my own version of a dynamic array with member variables and functions that I decided to implement and created on my own. Obviously it's nothing groundbreaking, but I didnt reference google a single time doing it, so there's something to be said for that. Any advice on optimizations/additions are welcome.
